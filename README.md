# InvoiceMaker
Invoice Maker is a web-based invoicing and sales tracking application built with React. It is designed to help small merchants record invoices, organize sales, and maintain basic financial records in a simple, intuitive interface. 
The project is inspired by existing tools such as Invoice Simple, and was built primarily as a portfolio project to demonstrate full-stack web development skills.
